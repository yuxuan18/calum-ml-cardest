This is a implementation of the paper: Data-Agnostic Cardinality Learning from Imperfect Workloads. 


This repo contains:

* ü™ê A simplified PyTorch implementation of [GRASP](GRASP), containing core functionalities of the GRASP system.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è A PyTorch implementation of [ArCDF](arcdf), improving on prior work [NeuroCDF](https://github.com/shoupzwu/selectivity_generalization).
* üõ∏ A self-contained [Python file](train_grasp_ceb.py) for reproducing the main experiments on CEB-IMDb-full.
* üõ∏ A self-contained [Python file](train_grasp_dsb.py) for reproducing the main experiments on DSB.
* üéâA [Python script](query_optimization.py) for running the query end-to-end experiments.


## Preparation
### Dataset/Workloads
1. Download [CEB-IMDb-full (i.e., CEB-IMDb-13k)](https://github.com/learnedsystems/CEB/blob/main/scripts/download_imdb_workload.sh) benchmark, and place the entire directory in your `IMDB_DIRECTORY` in `train_grasp_ceb.py` .
2. The DSB workload is contained in [this file](queries/dsb.csv).

### Query Optimization
1. Please download and install the modified PostgreSQL from [here](https://github.com/Nathaniel-Han/End-to-End-CardEst-Benchmark/tree/master).
2. Download the IMDb dataset from [here](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/job/imdb.tgz), and download the populated DSB dataset used in the paper from [here](https://mega.nz/file/iCI2hRhY#96_uiKFvFq0HUcoNNPRnVtMy5BbJ-1QuSry2d3l83xk). 
3. Please load the data into PostgreSQL.

## Usage



### Training GRASP over CEB-IMDb-full

To train the GRASP model over CEB-IMDb-full, run the following command:

    python train_grasp_ceb.py
    

### Training GRASP over DSB

To train the GRASP model over DSB, run the following command:

    python train_grasp_dsb.py
    

## Configuration

The training scripts can be configured by modifying the parameters in the respective `train_grasp_*.py` files. Key parameters include:
- `epoch`: Number of training epochs
- `feature_dim`: Dimension of CardEst models
- `lcs_dim`: dimension of the Learned Count Sketch Models
- `bs`: Batch size
- `lr`: Learning rate

## Utilities

The project includes various utility functions and classes located in the `CEB_utlities` and `dsb_utlities` directories. These utilities are used for data/workloads processing.
